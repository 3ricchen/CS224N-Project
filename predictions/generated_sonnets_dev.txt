Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
and say: "Kiss thee, miserable condition
But essence of fatherlessness's melancholy!"
As rivers of action tell me life's sacred parts
Dissolving in grief's retraction,
Black beauty from thee cruel substance join;
The reproach-forming beauty's praises imitate,
Giving sarcasm of disguise amongst bad comrades.
Thereby then is grief rubicund to thy sorrow,
And has gall lies of lament on one side;
[206] Nay that damnable hard meadows denote.
Instead were my soul's myself thou art lost,
And why would my outgrow'd tender


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
Of thy great sake, that more I wonder
Being in love with thy gift than then with me?
To help we both with sighs angry draw
And load all the world's home with joys too heavy.
Or when he sees I fail, what cause hath our quarrel
Against one so like as we are for sighs?
O that those generally offlicious call,
So in lonely house with mine own morn
I were once gentle, strong and sure with thee.
  Many saw me told that thou alone ever wert,
  And if seven notes dropped in verse wrought in thee


2
So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
And painful passion also, thou too,
Sought only to keep thyself alive;
So, notwithstanding me, as I and thee
Resemble a new and compound high
Excalating in such ways that all ~f
Of eternity brought but one death;
So now have I associated one day,
Yourself and all that would assert it,
In failure of all I by thee told
Of inyour habited state, inasidence;
 And, where it was myself in assent,
Another, that rich who criest me away,
O, name it and see


3
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
So much should Thy disgrace be.
The least I have is all that I am,
The most that makes all enough.
Thy care for me is the first having,
And the more's my greater care will be.
More shouldst thy fault with me have,
Than if thou overreached be unto me;
If any blame thou bearest thee, a prey
"Nothing must have may be spiteful,"
The worst in thee, going outside thine enemy,
Which that love cannot do so.
  And but there is whose hell his crime is,
  which other


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
Within thy heat and rot I will never depart,
Whereon truth haply forth I present thee.
When thou art endmatched there I rise wroth
But as a high rain upon the branch of me.
O, what fools thus deceive this painted mask,
That I which saw himself free and ground
In denoted truth lie presently under
Obedient to thy dishonest surety?
Yet not willing thus to so wonder should I be.
  When thee warm days become cooler I wax hot.


5
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
That wills well of another as thou thee must do;
And he true, which conceits thou doesn't see,
Can easily foretell what beauty will have,
And ere he leads the hurtles shall a man
Paradise or bower pass before him;
Thou gain'st nought by opening mine eyes;
Instruments enhance every sound,
And all we must live as othermen play,
Whilst sense sells more action in quick pain.
But since wretch his prizes are immortal,
How; highly mayst thou earn of him thyst worth.

When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
That indulged in fruitless satiety.
Now this love's grace and purity are stolen,
Badly concealed even from other sun
And stars; but that I have truly loved her,
Which I then bad afraid be argued
When life been rendered old led me to call
And ask in the age who her loving child
The odds were much longer must have been.
  So, looking on that I am seen to love
  And in a current of time disdaining dissembling,
  I perceive joy found and being seen do learn.


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Or should I set myself when thy minds publish,
X. if there shall never be another whiche I -x,
Something whereof to them above I put mine ear,
Or should I fain work alluring harm,
Y. should images in chinks give place to thine eyes,
And how words and uses would both go to disgrace
By faged ratchet, making painting more sad than read;
While on philters' beads should youth sit and grow.
  If by images so great the greatest neglect
  Were ungetting horror what the least increase in me
  Is broken


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express sore
My dispossessed wit: besides,, enough of the bitterness
To bear words ill spoken in me would vail memory,
Taking passage for surely above object;
But their mean ingratitude may suffice me in snare,
Since liveily myself may still meet the severity,
That in adversity pains and limits cannot hide
So as I can mar the stress and girth of your words.
  Banish your spite not;  Weak cease to depend on weak;


9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
While all their annoyance with kindly violets depicts.
Why, perhaps your wonderful aspect may whet my egotism;
For sometimes poor feeling infects lust and force,
And what the easy being pays with ah! here's fear;
With now deception constitutes goggling glee.
Now that my love's seeming state is nut,
O, who should if I had any grudge get,
Speaking deceits if soft but with different dear?
  Their spite cheats you since thy love was as I.


10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
And, better than mine, thy state of love seems true,
Assured by the waxing rust in thy memory
Of love I still waited with unstained images;
Concerned it was that wonderful pride
Of humility and love which seems more comfortable.
I am thoughtful that he that saw thee in life
Shall see thee only in death; yet the square
Pleasing thee now that live and visit me are indeed,
An ancient sable photograph in
God's blue jewel of the true so true,
Which I may keep? thus have your heart's thoughts taxed me.
  Tell me

Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
Of here form's waste away;
But German wilts, queen of his love, in her hunting,
Which times following disappears forever.
When, doubtful-begett, he children were again
Sick, her ravenin fled, and it too was dead,
Grow up next to his sick former saucy hate;
All what was her cares but mire bright to keep
Still by him where it lay in perfect captivity,
These he already raised to an unprecedented height,
Which not are waterfyred to Boston,
Nor hunted off to mischance no more by fairies
