Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
And sunken stars in their aspect darkened;
For thou in them art bright and they in thee dark:
Thou in them art bright, and they in thee dark
Desire thy change, as the sad wight doth love
To change his state with the time and place.
They look on thee with jealous love,
Seeking what they can steal from thee;
Yet they themselves, being lovers, know
Till they have had their want obtained that thou mayst be.
  The raven that flies in heaven's sweetest air
  For thy sweet love doth alack come down


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
For how shall I suffer when mine own sweet love sheds
Thy blood whilst I, a murd'rous coward,
Look upon myself and curse my fate?
O, no! That my friend should feel my trespass
And yet mock me with that same hurt shows
How true and true friends are. They will suffer
Thy sweet love to wound me even in thy breast,
Still tenderly watching my bleeding flank,
That I, for thy sake, will be thy victim also;
  And they will bear it so much longer, for thou art my friend,
  Than I'll bear to be


2
So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
May steal thy treasure, even my life.
O, what poverty, what ignominy, what misery,
What barren shame, what heavy sorrow,
What wanton disgrace, what base lasciviousness
Is in the sight of thy beauty wrought?
No, love, it is not so; it is but beauty's self
Struggling with itself, it kills the flower.
O, let me be as thy table and rest
Within thine own sweet love's gentle hold,
Whilst it doth but beautify thy table,
Making of it other things than sweet be


3
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
Needing nothing to vex me with return;
And being thy slave, how shall I know
When thou thyself depart'st from me,
And me, being thy slave, do thine own loving will?
O, therefore, take heed what thou do'st say,
Although thy will is such, as I am assured,
Thyself to thy sweetheart's use doth consent;
And nothing behind that consent doth lie,
Save that thou dost what thou wilt do willingly.
  To leave me thou mayst leave,
  As soon as thou will, but


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
Then, if for my sake thou wilt remain,
Upon my love's account thy fair appearance lies,
A prey to the ravenous tiger; but if thou wilt depart,
A loss is still felt by thy sweet semblance
To have that which thou didst thyself self so cherish.
For she that for thy love doth love thee doth lose
That she should love thee in case thou leave her,
Even that her loss is her gain; and being lost,
The giver of that loss finds that he hath.
  Then, be a loss to thyself and no loss to


5
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
And in it treasure thy souls' reproach;
Yet dare thou rob them of that which they cherish?
Look in thy glass, and there appears a face
More lovely and more true than theirs,
Than theirs at least in grace and truth doth sit,
Beating thine ear that doth steal thy precious love away.
O, blame me not if thy glass shows thy sweet face
To be false and changed new! Wilt thou not haply say
"This fair world I see through thy glass is false,
And this my love is false, for it doth lie"?



6
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Without all training, without all aid,
Commit to her own craft alone.
But when she assures me that she is made
Of thee, my rose, my all-holy flower,
I know not what to think but that she is true.
For nothing so sweet and so fair
As thy sweet self in me doth lie,
And nothing so true nor so perfect
As those roses which thou dost form in me.
  For she hath not mixed truth with lies in me;
  Thy sweet self in me doth deceive.


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Make no excuse for my crime,
But place my guilt in the breast of kings.
O, do not, when I am condemned to die,
My fleshly fears hold me back from thee,
Nor flattery thy praise confounds;
Give me leave, gentle reader, to sigh
Thy just displeasure, but no farther.
O, make thee another heart, other eyes than mine
To look on my sufferance and to condemn me more.
  Make another thee, yet me thou hast not created,
  Since my substance doth in thy breast lie buried.


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
Thy own true thought more truly.
O, learn to read what is not written,
And to speak what is true in such sort
As this thy knowledge cannot but express,
Not with a poet's invention,
But simple and simple truth, true in sort,
That thy true int'rim may in praise be shown;
That thy true understanding may in good turns explain
To others thy beauty's cause and thy dear virtue's show.
  Look what is new and what old is seen,
  And if any ambiguity found, remove it;
  No need to learn to know when thou


9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
And that in thee their errors seem worthy.
Kind hearts do tend to their objects sweetly,
But true hearts do ever strive to do their best;
And by their fruits do they know their truth.
Kind hearts sometimes do spite themselves,
Applying their kind treatment to others' wrongs
And thinking themselves good only by their successes;
Kind hearts often do wrong in other's eyes,
Doing nothing to encourage their true behavior,
Suff'ring their neighbor's benefit and thinking themselves blessed
If their neighbor were to prosper by their sins.
  I do not say this to be pit


10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
Within that pale vault whereon mortality maketh his tomb,
And there dignified is thy love, yet so bereft
Of all sentiment that touches it; yet there lives within
That inward love that loves and fears no blot,
That it cannot wink or grow pale to show his go,
On the boundary of a frontier green.
O, but that loving boundary-land which separates thee
From hell's sharp enmity, there dwells love,
That it may green with virtue show his black date,
Making his shade thy equal gray and his green his praise.
  Lo, thus


11
Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
Of her lambs' fountains the same;
So thou, thyself art thy own keeper,
Whilst the world's other loves are wont to pass
By thee like shadows that hide in his sight.
No loving thoughts in thee they that do mock,
Hath anything to love or hate that proceeds.
All ill deeds that do proceed from thee
Are but ill-doing thoughts in me,
Which to myself I hold so despising,
That I do everything thou wilt do;
  And nothing 'gainst myself thou gav'st,
  To touch thyself
