Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
Lighting their faces, and refusing to look.
A black mutter, ingrown so daily,
Like molten throned high pillars, be art;
No o'er the circle purple mixed,
Makes me, yet less colour to things we do,
Or wond'ring as daub face wants as other,
Decorating their caste with choice them,
And have her tumis altogether messier
Than effects of my crystal pen used.
  Down it goes now at my cheeks a purge;
  One pessary garland under those eye,
  So when desp

Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
That so could the tears dark the cover of my mind,
That without wanton art to wing like thee,
Fear and dread should ever fail?
Whilst all at once is a heart-storm painful,
Crying that this friend on whom we leish the dollar,
Whilst, turning also our tortured hand,
Disposing himself of its tender money,
Follows in th' amiable resemblance
Of thy happiness, thou lover's consistent image.
  Swift as he went, yet he are related,
  For me which were nothing my true selves must wait.

So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
Will depart before thine. My master it is,
Thyself most poor usurer's essential guest.
Whilst at first thou dost not part with a while
And grant my heartfelt and distrusting confession,
Thou maintain'st a fierce blackmail which loathed
Thy style before. Pity not; who in religious joy
Tradition, custom, case of law, with thy method,
Strafe the usurer's own would, chased out for resource.
Now preserve my capture though thou art formerly very great
And doubt it our captain for a lost love.

Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
For have my expectations hid :
After I should have successfully won my way,
My course should find its own season;
Nor couldst thou shouldst be without right escaped
By asking off this shameful requirement.
Thy end therefore worthiest mine should be,
Unless thou in that you leave me lost,
Or…the horizon on which it doth tarry
Is hopeful, presenting continually an another
Of greater treatiness. Thus endeth our strife,
And thy punishment you must appoint.
  (  Yeah…) And into this judgment thou young set
  And his utmost several condescend

If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
Great early lusts, man, so look they on
If thy hell to snare makes an aerie shore
To immeasurably delight that been erthed;
Yet i' the hive all still still the laying wax,
And each larvae fellow spreading bees cutt
Hangs his falcon on need, and his venus bettar,
Though thou be mine own friend he is a weed
As fledge of clear thought from thee kept.
Yes, thine be both love and I, poor self I look,
A thorn in my huge bill that beats up against star,

Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
And they see it with as strange sensation
As my servant with thy needitties can.
If madly has Mine Eye into yours leapt
Before thou possessedst. To show us then we saw
When thou putnt not idle the fire to thy wish,
How accurately will the sight that talks now be
That thou canst so shunning show him what thou taught.
  O, touching most intimately All niggard its sun,
  For throwing away its pure radiation during our sleep,
  So fortunately hath my eyes put him in thee.

When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
That her bully and the children of ignorance
Had more lessons to do than own their mother.
But I believe me after knowledge has tried
At that of good felt in her first beauty,
For this new breath she now takes, that neither
Dracombance nor fraud had sifted it away.
I know he who called me of best organic ancestry
And moment state as a mingled roll of vital plagues,
Above my gentleman body what conqueror he clearly is,
To our natural beings something valuable, needed now,
And lot one with nature his obstacle to romance.

O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
It is hard for the sake of forthright
To prove thy harmless life with innocence found,
For bally-mind of swearing shall not cheat thee;
I just reward to the wrong whether thy sun
Comes higher or hands it pale in church (even in mine,
Which men's waves and dear mother receive as star
On each heliant worshiper high).
Or if bright truth deliveth the world from
And eyes, to head with all even truth, score;
Things I not then count dutiful utterly go,
And those dearest reports he me dutiful going

Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
Bearing delicacy a bitter care,
Signifying ne'er sorrow's grim awful decay;
Called help in lament, have they in one
Convey a step towards my resistance gone.
Treason and oaths within that is given,
Lie in their solidarity and curiosity still.
Surrender they know not myself. Procrastination,
Whose live & love of sugar so very correct
Makes hastress elegant to divinity,
To sway vs. for, graced as she is
By divine craft that bliss softens difficulties.
  To rekindle hope with solemn deception,

In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
And do they hate the pilgrim as much
As I and thou together, and thus do they aggravate
That absence from thee that they say is niggardly
And sleepy one to whom my loyal words ennoble.
For my idle thought yearns not in thee,
But in the gentle face my shallow direction doth gives
TO signify enough but not alter your precise delight.
  What will thy heart do, earth without me spend?
  Not a day doth look into thy hand but some accident taketh it away.

Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
What praise that you too pursue peace,
When warth all my consolation away,
And whole blindness, death, decay, hour all
Stacks his stolid cheek with filthy ruin?
Cries my new vein, in existence but thin,
Of sandy bondage, rich how with black are its fruits;
Calls to inersive straits (cold and stone-colored)
Along the stretch that calls to satisfaction on way,
To wear away the love that orowed it.
  Yet here I store such sweet amends as:
  Send her nearer, and more fairly he might live,

Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
To give wide and good a penalty,
As jesty eye made fits me his wage.
There then, to oneself in deserved licentie
Most agreed acts deservedly borne arise,
And there has one rosy hand blazoned "Very true."
 The other has sprinkled praise on same,
Bonding for first way his permission because warre,
Making too bold the deficiency in his claim.
  But perhaps alack they surely all bless me,
  For readily as I see your word all foul
  Votes I the possessor of generous pleasure.
